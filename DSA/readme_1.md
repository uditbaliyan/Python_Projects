Perfect 👌 let’s turn that roadmap into a **ready-to-practice problem set**. I’ll give you 5–6 carefully chosen problems per category (all from LeetCode / common interview sets). These cover increasing difficulty but stay focused on the exact pattern.

---

⚡ Strategy:

* Do them **in this order** (start from Two Pointers → Linked Lists).
* In each pattern, solve **easy → medium → hard**.
* Don’t rush efficiency at first; just recognize the *pattern*. Efficiency will come naturally once you’ve seen 4–5 problems of the same type.

Want me to also **make a 30-day practice schedule** (like 2–3 problems per day, mixing patterns gradually) so you don’t burn out?
